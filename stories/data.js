      'With these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor.  Seeing that she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess.  She then swept it all out the door.  After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her foot again.  Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to the courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had come to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land.',

      'The splendid fellow sprang to his feet, and grasping me by the shoulder raised his sword on high, exclaiming: "And had the choice been left to me I could not have chosen a more fitting mate for the first princess of Barsoom.  Here is my hand upon your shoulder, John Carter, and my word that Sab Than shall go out at the point of my sword for the sake of my love for Helium, for Dejah Thoris, and for you.

      'For a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and, although the heat was excessive, he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to see the Thing more clearly.  He fancied even then that the cooling of the body might account for this, but what disturbed that idea was the fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder. And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of the cylinder was rotating on its body.

I talked to her reassuringly, pointing out that the Martians were tied to the Pit by sheer heaviness, and at the utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but she answered only in monosyllables.  Had it not been for my promise to the innkeeper, she would, I think, have urged me to stay in Leatherhead that night.  Would that I had!  Her face, I remember, was very white as we parted.

Passepartout remained alone in the house in Saville Row. "Faith," muttered Passepartout, somewhat flurried, "I\'ve seen people at Madame Tussaud\'s as lively as my new master!" Madame Tussaud\'s "people," let it be said, are of wax, and are much visited in London; speech is all that is wanting to make them human.
